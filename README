= libinputmapper =

libinputmapper is a simple library to assemble input event translation tables.
These tables allow simple conversions of input events. It operates on the
"struct input_event" linux event objects and converts ->code arguments according
to the internal tables.

The purpose of these translation tables is to fixup broken device keymaps that
we cannot change in the kernel for backwards compatibility reasons. Furthermore,
these tables allow to fix cross-device incompatibilities by remapping input into
a known common format.

All kinds of translation tables are supported. The main tables are provided via
udev's hwdb and provide known static fixup tables for broken devices. However,
library users can easily create dynamic tables on-the-fly.
